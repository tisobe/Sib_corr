0. Go to a directory: /data/mta/Script/Sib/Correct_excess/ or wherever you want to work at.

1. get a list of observations between <start> and <stop>.

	perl /data/mta/MTA/bin/sib_corr_find_observation.perl <start> <stop>

   where the format for <start> and <stop> is MM/DD/YY,HH:MM:SS. The output will be directed 
   into "./acis_obs" file. This script must be run on rhodes. Steps 3, 4, and 5 can be run on colossus.
   (probably running on colossus is faster).

2. check each observation visually to see  whether the source is extended.
   Use ocatdata2html.cgi and check ROSAT data.
 
	https://icxc.harvard.edu/mta/CUS/Usint/ocatdata2html.cgi?<obsid>

	or run:

	perl ./Sib_corr/mk_img_html.perl

	to create all ROSAT image on one page:

	/data/mta/Script/ACIS/SIB/Correct_excess/target_image.html


   In general, remove all abell clusters, planets, comets, and all bright x ray sources
   such as crab, cas A  and M87.

3. A new list contains lines like:
	03412   FXRT011030      ACIS-S  Nov 29 2001 11:09AM     123505739       9771    100032

   run to extract data from archive:

	perl /data/mta/MTA/bin/sib_corr_get_data.perl 

	perl ./Sib_corr/sib_corr_get_data_lev2.perl

   run the lev2 version first, since the data size is smaller and it will finish quicker.
   then after removing all un-wanted observations (extended sources), you can run lev 1
    version.

   where we assume "./acis_obs", the list we just created, is in the same directory.

   Extracted data will be saved in "./Input" directory.


4. run the main script:

	set:
		rm -rf param
		mkdir param
		source /home/mta/bin/reset_param
		setenv PFILES "${PDIRS}:${SYSPFILES}" 
		set path = (/home/ascds/DS.release/bin/  $path)
		setenv MTA_REPORT_DIR  /data/mta/Script/ACIS/SIB/Correct_excess/Reportdir/
					of (your working directory, with /Reportdir at the ned).

	perl /data/mta/MTA/bin/sib_corr_comp_sib.perl

   This will create results in ./Outdir/lres/mtaf<obsid>_*_sibkg1.fits.

5. Combined these data

	perl /data/mta/MTA/bin/sib_corr_comb.perl <start time> <end time>

	where <start time>:	<year>:<y_date>:<hour>:<min>:<sec>
	      <end time>:	<year>:<y_date>:<hour>:<min>:<sec>

	The results are in Data   (such as ./Data/lres_ccd3_merged.fits)

6 Plot data

	perl /data/mta/MTA/bin/sib_corr_plot_lres.perl <year> <month>
	perl ./Sib_corr/sib_corr_plot_lres.perl (for Lev 2)
		----- run this on rhodes (need to access /data/mta4/MTA/data/no_data.gif)

	where <year>		year of the observation
	      <month>		month of the observations

	the results are in ./Plots/

7. Check plots.
	check plots to see whether any very high dose observations are still around.
		xv ./Plots/indep_plot_ccd7.gif

	if you find one, find which one is the high dose observation form the list we made.
	go to ./Outdir/lres/, make ./Outdir/lres/save/ dirctory and move that data to the directory

	to do this more efficiently, run ./Sib_corr/find_time.perl > tlist
	then dmlist "./Data/lres_ccd7_merged.fits[cols time,hard]" opt=data > zout

	and find all sources count rate > 150 or so (you can decide the level).

	run step 5 and 6 to see whether all the high doese/extended sources are removed.
	if not, just repeat.

8. Created plots for long terms for lev 2 data

	run:
		perl Sib_corr/acis_sib_one_year_plot_lev2.perl
		perl Sib_corr/acis_sib_long_term_lev2.perl
	and 
		perl Sib_corr/acis_sib_comb_plot_lev2.perl

8. Clearn up.
	move all resulted fits files (from Data directory) and plots (from Plots) to a web site
	/data/mta/www/mta_sib/...

	then, remove all fits files from Input, Outdir, and Data. It could take upto 10% of a disk space.
